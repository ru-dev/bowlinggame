Write a program to keep score of a bowling game. Please note this 

challenge should be interactive. Please use OOP to implement your 

solution.

**Rules**

1. There are 10 pins total, each counts as 1 point. 

2. Each frame has up to 2 balls that can be thrown. 

3. If a strike is bowled (all pins knocked down on first throw), the 

second ball is not thrown. 

4. A strike counts as 10 points, plus the value of the next 2 balls 

thrown. A maximum of 30 points is possible per frame 

(10+10+10). 

5. A spare (all pins knocked down in 2 throws) counts as 10 points 

plus the value of the next ball thrown. A maximum of 20 points 

is possible for a spare (10+10). 

6. The 10th frame is a special frame whereby up to 3 balls can be 

thrown if a strike or a spare are bowled. 

7. If a strike is thrown on the first ball, 2 additional balls are 

thrown. 

8. If a spare is thrown on the second ball, an extra ball is thrown. 

9. The maximum score possible for a game is 300 (10 frames x 30 

points per frame) if only strikes are bowled. 

Bonus:â€¨When 2 strikes are bowled in a row, that is called a "Turkey". 

Mark the bowling frame appropriately if a

"Turkey" is bowled.
